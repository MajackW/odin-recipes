        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These sausage balls are a real crowd pleaser<br>
            , whether you serve them as a breakfast or brunch treat,<br>
             a holiday party appetizer, or a game-day nibble.<br>
             Savory sausage, store-bought biscuit mix, and sharp Cheddar <br>
             cheese team up for a yummy savory flavor that can't be beaten!<br>
             My family makes these every Christmas morning.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground pork sausage, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 cups biscuit baking mix</li>
            <li>12 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Combine room temperature sausage,<br>
                biscuit mix, and shredded Cheddar together<br>
                in a large bowl; mix with your hands until well combined.<br>
                The mixture may seem dry at first,<br>
                but keep mixing until it comes together evenly.</li>
            <li>Roll mixture into about 30 walnut-sized balls; transfer to a baking sheet</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown<br>
                and sausage is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
