                    <li>2 cups biscuit baking mix</li>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
                    <li>Combine room temperature sausage,
                        biscuit mix, and shredded Cheddar together
                        in a large bowl; mix with your hands until well combined.
                        The mixture may seem dry at first,
                        but keep mixing until it comes together evenly.</li>
                    <li>Roll mixture into about 30 walnut-sized balls; transfer to a baking sheet</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown
                        and sausage is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
