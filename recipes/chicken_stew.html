        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In this recipe, chicken thighs and a creamy cannellini bean,<br>
            tomato, and spinach stew cook in a single skillet with Boursin<br>
            cheese melted in at the finish. This high protein dinner is<br>
            rich and delicious, and pretty straightforward.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 ounces baby spinach</li>
            <li>1 (5.3 ounce) package garlic and herb spreadable cheese, such as Boursin®</li>
            <li>2 (14 ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>1 pint grape tomatoes or cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup finely chopped onion</li>
            <li>6 skin on, bone in chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Season chicken thighs with salt, pepper, and<br>
                garlic powder and place skin side down in the hot skillet.<br>
                Cook undisturbed until well browned, crisp,<br>
                and releases easily from the skillet, 6 to 7 minutes
            </li>
            <li>Flip chicken and cook an additional 1 to 2 minutes. <br>
                Remove chicken from the pan and set aside<br>
                (chicken will not be cooked through at this point).
            </li>
            <li>Add onion to the drippings in the pan, and cook<br>
                until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes,<br>
                and cook until tomatoes soften and begin to burst,<br>
                4 to 5 minutes. Stir in beans and remaining salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Return chicken to the pan, skin side up, along with any juices<br>
                that have accumulated. Return to a simmer; cover, reduce heat slightly,<br>
                and cook until chicken is tender and cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes.<br>
                An instant read thermometer inserted near the center should read<br>
                165 degrees F (74 degrees C)
            </li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a serving platter. Stir in spinach until<br>
                wilted and then add in Boursin. Stir until melted and heated through.<br>
                Season to taste with more salt and pepper. 

            </li>
            <li>Serve chicken over bean stew.</li>
        </ol>
