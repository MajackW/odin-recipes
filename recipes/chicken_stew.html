                <p>In this recipe, chicken thighs and a creamy cannellini bean,
                    tomato, and spinach stew cook in a single skillet with Boursin
                    cheese melted in at the finish. This high protein dinner is
                    rich and delicious, and pretty straightforward.</p>

                    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="steps">
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
                    <li>Season chicken thighs with salt, pepper, and
                        garlic powder and place skin side down in the hot skillet.
                        Cook undisturbed until well browned, crisp,
                        and releases easily from the skillet, 6 to 7 minutes
                    </li>
                    <li>Flip chicken and cook an additional 1 to 2 minutes.
                        Remove chicken from the pan and set aside
                        (chicken will not be cooked through at this point).
                    </li>
                    <li>Add onion to the drippings in the pan, and cook
                        until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes,
                        and cook until tomatoes soften and begin to burst,
                        4 to 5 minutes. Stir in beans and remaining salt and pepper.
                    </li>
                    <li>Return chicken to the pan, skin side up, along with any juices
                        that have accumulated. Return to a simmer; cover, reduce heat slightly,
                        and cook until chicken is tender and cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes.
                        An instant read thermometer inserted near the center should read
                        165 degrees F (74 degrees C)
                    </li>
                    <li>Transfer chicken to a serving platter. Stir in spinach until
                        wilted and then add in Boursin. Stir until melted and heated through.
                        Season to taste with more salt and pepper. 

                    </li>
                    <li>Serve chicken over bean stew.</li>
